### #Figure Friday


![logo](/assets/Figure_Fridays_banner.jpg)

Every Friday Plotly will release a data set and a sample figure. The community will have one week â€“ until midnight of the following Thursday â€“ to enhance that figure, build your own Plotly figure or create a Dash app.

The goal of this initiative is to enhance our Plotly skills, collaborate among community members, and share our creations with the world, while we develop our personal portfolio of data visualizations and apps.

To participate in the initiative:

- Create - use the weekly data set to build your own Plotly visualization or Dash app. Or, enhance the sample figure provided.
- Submit - post your creation to LinkedIn or Twitter with the hashtags #FigureFriday and #plotly by midnight Thursday, your time zone.
- Celebrate - join the Figure Friday sessions 30 to showcase your creation, receive feedback from the community, and vote on your favorite visualization.

Ready, Set, Go!

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the Figure Friday tag 55 on July 12 to discover the first weekly data set.
